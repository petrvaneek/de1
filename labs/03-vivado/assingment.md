### Three-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer

1. Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_3bit_4to1.vhd`. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of comparator_4bit is
begin
process (a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i,sel_i1,sel_i2) is begin
	  if (sel_i1 ='0' and sel_i2 = '0') then
      f_o <= a_i;
  elsif (sel_i1 ='0' and sel_i2 = '1') then
      f_o <= b_i;
  elsif (sel_i1 ='1' and sel_i2 = '0') then
      f_o <= c_i;
  else
      f_o <= d_i;
  end if;
 end process;
end architecture Behavioral;

```

2. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!

3. Listing of pin assignments for the Nexys A7 board in `nexys-a7-50t.xdc`. **DO NOT list** the whole file, just your switch and LED settings.
